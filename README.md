# Elegoo-Mars3
Some usefull parts for Elegoo Mars 3 MSLA printer.

Some SVG and STL files i created in Inkscape and Rhino 7 for my Elegoo Mars 3 printer.



## Elegoo Mars 3 Screen Protector Gasket
I had an damaged Resin tank which leads to a dirty LCD-Screen protector film. 
When i tried to remove the hardend resin, i broke the protector film and had also 
renew the black gasket around the LCD. Hard to find this part. You can buy a new 
LCD Screen which is delivered with a new gasket. But the LCD itself was OK.

Since i bought an Cameo 4 plotter, i decided to cut my own gasket. I use a standard Vinyl foil.
You can also use a better quality foil used for automotiv stuff. 
The original one has a thickness of 0,11 mm (both, the gasket and the FEP film).

## Elegoo Mars 3 Additional Screen Protector under VAT (VAT size) and Seal
To make things easy, i made this additional Screen Protector under the VAT 
and a Seal to prevent Resin running under the the Protector foil. I cut both 
with the Silhouette Cameo 4 plotter. The Seal foil should as thin as possible.

## Elegoo Mars 3 Magnetic Build Plate Holder for IPA Tank.
My Mercury 2in1 washer/curer has only a metal box inside. Maybe there is a pro Version
which has also a Build-Plate holder. The downside of this holder is, you can't close the sealed 
tank. You have to wash your parts with the tank open.

I created my own Build-Plate holder. It has a magnet on top
I placed another magnet (both 20x3 mm Neodym-Magnets) on top of the tank cover.
Works great.
